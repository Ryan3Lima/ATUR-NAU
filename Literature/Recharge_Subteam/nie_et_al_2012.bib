	abstract = {Over the past century, mesquite trees (Prosopis spp.) have exhibited substantial increase in abundance throughout areas in the American Southwest that were once dominated by desert grassland. To assess hydrological consequences of mesquite encroachment, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to simulate progressive mesquite encroachments in the upper San Pedro watershed (U.S./Mexico). The simulated average annual basin evapotranspiration (ET) increases with mesquite encroachment, leading to the decrease of annual water yield and percolation by 9.8\% and 9.7\%, respectively. Substantial increase of ET (up to 19.19 mm) and decrease of percolation, and surface runoff (to À12.90 and À3.20 mm, respectively) were observed in the southeast, middle-west, and northern subwatersheds of the basin and the most signiﬁcant decrease of surface runoff (around À35.8\%) was simulated during the wet period. In addition, a non-linear hydrological response relative to mesquite encroachment was observed, i.e. hydrological processes changed markedly until a certain amount (approximately 40\%) of grassland was removed, indicating that the strongest increase of ET occurred in the earliest stages of encroachment. Consequently, changes in vegetation physiognomy, such as mesquite encroachment, have broad implications for landuse management especially in regard to reliable water supplies in arid and semi-arid environments.},

** Goal **
To evaluate the impact of mesquite encroachment on hydrology in the upper san pedro watershed and provides insights for environmental decision-making 
** Methods **


Utilized the SWAT model to simulate land use scenarios and evaluate hydrological consequences of mesquite encroachment.


adjusted various parameters in the SWAT model such as lateral flow, base flow, surface runoff estimates and ET methods.


** Key Findings **


mesquite encroachment leads to increased ET and decreased water yield/percolation non-linearly with significant changes when about 40\% of grassland is removed


Impacts are more pronounced during wet periods; the complete replacement of grassland by mesquite increases basin ET but decreases surface runoff. 


** Implications **


Changes in vegetation, like mesquite encroachment, have broad implications for water management in arid environments. 


Understanding these impacts can aid decision-makers in managing landscapes affected by vegetation changes.
